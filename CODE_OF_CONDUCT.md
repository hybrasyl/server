# Hybrasyl Project Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, the Hybrasyl Project pledges to making participation in our project and our community a positive experience for everyone, regardless of any differences we may have.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

As project maintainers, it is our responsibility to foster this positive environment and to take corrective action when needed to encourage and defend that environment.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing 
the project or its community. Use common sense. It applies to our Discord server, to PRs, to commits and code itself, to websites, to our Facebook page. 

As a community of users and developers, this code of conduct forms the basis of a community covenant to act in ways which are reasonable, positive, and beneficial.

## Enforcement

If you feel that someone in the project is creating an unfriendly, hostile, or simply not fun environment for you, please feel free to contact us directly: info@hybrasyl.com. We promise to keep your complaints anonymous and to handle them fairly and as reasonably as possible.
